# AI-Driven SVUnit Test Generator

This repository contains the source code for automating the generation of SystemVerilog assertions and unit tests using artificial intelligence (AI) based on a predefined VHDL architecture. The tool leverages the GPT API to enhance verification efficiency in SystemVerilog environments.

The project integrates AI-driven techniques to automate the generation of test cases and assertions within the SVUnit framework, streamlining the testing process and reducing the manual effort required for digital system verification.

For more detailed information on installation, usage, and implementation, please refer to the documentation provided in the file [Documentation.docx](./Documentation.docx).
